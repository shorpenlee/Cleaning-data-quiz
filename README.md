#Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Author: Shaopeng Li
Date: Apr.1st  2020

## Goal of the Project
1. A tidy data set, saved as **tidyData.txt**
2. A link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis.
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that the author performed to clean up the data called **CodeBook.md**. There is also a **README.md** in the repo with the scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. The code of data cleaning and processing is **run_analysis.R**
